# ECE470-Dish-Recycling-Robot
UIUC ECE470 project
The dish recycling robot will be served mainly in restaurants to help collect used plates and
bowls from customerâ€™s table and send to dishwasher to save human labor. The robot has two
modes programmed in its system. The first is idle mode, which the robot stays in one position or
patrol around waiting for commands. The second is working mode, which the robot will goes to
one table and waiting for customers to put their tableware on robot arms, and then the robot will
contain the dishes into its body automatically. Moreover, there are two ways to trigger the robot
into working mode. The first is when customers finish their dishes and press a button to call the
robot to come. The second is when customers wave their hands to stop the patrolling robot.

Our robot dedicates to save human labor in the restaurant. This robot can also be used with dish
serving robot at the same time.
